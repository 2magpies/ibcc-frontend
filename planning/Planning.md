## How We Did It.

- We began on the first day doing an initial setup of our app. It was bare bones, and only the skeleton. For this we decided that mob programming would be a better approach.
  - Mob Programming: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming
- Next we decided to do split up and do pair programming, 2 on the front-end and 2 on the back-end, where we swap roles being navigator and driver, every 45 minutes or so.
- For the front-end, we decided to build components by the order they were going to appear on the page. Starting with the search component, then the browse logic, then the events being populated and etc. We did most of our fetching from local host pre-deployment.
- For the Backend, we decided to create our routes, then test them and only after the test passed did we move on to the next one.
- We first deployed our backend since that was the first thing to be more than 50% ready which went very well. Then towards the end of the week, we pushed our front-end.
- After doing final checks we decided that we were happy with our product.

### WorkFlow

- Create a branch > Push to branch > Make Pull request > Alert team members > Team members checked for Merge conflicts and alerted everyone when merge was completed > Everyone pull master.

## Meetings

- We had regular scrum meetings and standup meetings with our team lead everyday. Our Scrum meetings were always 30 minutes before our daily standup meeting which served as a nice warm up to delivery concise and accurate information whether that be what we worked on or what issues we came across. Having those scrum meetings helped us get and stay all on the same page. Notes were also kept by our Scrum master: Myshawne Stallings, which served as a reminder to where we were at as a group as well as what we all were assigned.
